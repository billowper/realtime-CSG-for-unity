My fork of [RCSG](https://github.com/LogicalError/realtime-CSG-for-unity) witha bunch of random hacks, fixes, experiments and probably new bugs.

* made unity scene visibility work properly
* merged a couple other scene overlay fixes
* [crack stitching](https://github.com/billowper/realtime-CSG-for-unity/pull/3) merged
* some brush + line rendering perf improvements, maybe?
* more soon?
